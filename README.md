# lenny-helper

Lenny is a self-learning AI that can remember the answers to any question the user might have. Lenny is still in early stages, so most aspects are unstable and incomplete.

So far Lenny is kind of useless because you need to know the answer to your question for Lenny to learn.

If you want to run Lenny, download all the files and run `python3 main.py` which will start the whole program.
