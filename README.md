# lenny-helper

Lenny is a self-learning AI that can remember the answers to any question the user might have. Lenny is still in early stages, so most aspects are unstable and incomplete.

So far Lenny is kind of useless because you need to know the answer to your question for Lenny to learn.

### 0.3.3 updates:
 - Cleaned up some code and made things more efficient
 - `help` and `services` inputs now have the same formatting as the main input
 - Moved all command functions into one file to save space
 - Fixed a so far unknown bug regarding service toggling
 
### Using Lenny
 1. Clone this repository
 2. cd to this repository in terminal
 3. run the command: `python3 main.py`
